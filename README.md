# dotfiles

The `install` script will place all of the configuration (dot) files in the correct place and cleanup any unwanted files.

This script is idempotent such that it can be run any number of times producing the same result.

Currently, the following utilities are supported:
 - zsh
 - vim
 - git
 - gnupg
 - pass
